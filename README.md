# deal-or-no-deal
The hit gameshow Deal or No Deal in Python with modifications for research purposes. An additional gamemode was added which allows the player to propose an offer and the banker decides whether to accept or reject. Data is saved to a relational sqlite database with 3 tables (one for data about entire games, one for data about individual rounds played, and one with errors from players not paying attention)
